# Passengers-Survival---Data-Visualization

## Introduction
The Titanic dataset contains information about passengers aboard the Titanic, including their demographic details and survival status. This dataset is widely used for exploratory data analysis (EDA) and machine learning projects. It typically includes the following columns:

- PassengerId: An identifier for each passenger.
- Survived: A binary variable indicating whether the passenger survived (1) or not (0).
- Pclass: The passenger class, representing the socio-economic status of the passenger (1st, 2nd, or 3rd class).
- Name: The name of the passenger.
- Sex: The gender of the passenger (male or female).
- Age: The age of the passenger. This column may contain missing values.
- SibSp: The number of siblings or spouses aboard the Titanic for each passenger.
- Parch: The number of parents or children aboard the Titanic for each passenger.
- Ticket: The ticket number.
- Fare: The fare paid by the passenger for the journey.
- Cabin: The cabin number of the passenger. This column may contain missing values.
- Embarked: The port of embarkation for each passenger (Cherbourg, Queenstown, or Southampton).

## Questions for Analysis
1. What is the distribution of passengers' ages on the Titanic?
2. How many passengers survived vs. not survived? Visualize the count using a bar plot.
3. What is the distribution of passenger class (Pclass) on the Titanic?
4. Visualize the distribution of passenger ages for each passenger class using a box plot.
5. Create a pair plot to explore relationships between numerical variables like age, fare, and the number of siblings/spouses (sibsp) aboard.
6. How does the survival rate differ based on passenger class? Visualize it using a bar plot.
7. Create a heatmap to visualize the correlation between numerical features (age, fare, sibsp, parch) in the Titanic dataset.
8. How does the survival rate vary based on gender (sex)? Visualize it using a bar plot.
9. What is the distribution of fares paid by passengers on the Titanic?
10. Create a violin plot to compare the distribution of ages for survivors and non-survivors.
